  annote = {The bond distance between the aromatic rings and the iron coordination center is not well defined by the selection of the 6-311G basis set. Including the correct diffuse functions to describe the atomic valency of the transition metal is necessary for describing the molecular geometry of ferrocene. New orbital exponents and contraction coefficients for the d orbitals are included in the improved 6-31G* basis set called m6-31G. The use of more polarization functions overestimates the bond distance whereas the m6-31G basis set proves to be more balanced when modeling 3d-4s orbitals for this system },

  annote = {This paper outlines a general process for computing molecular energies within an accurate range of +/- 2 kcal/mol. Because of the deficiency of single configuration HF calculations for long range/bond dissociation energies, Moller Plesset perturbation theory may be applied up to the fourth order. The tendency of some MPn calculations failure to converge necessitates the implementation of the quadratic configuration interaction (QCI) technique. The molecular energies of various chemical systems calculated with MP theory are reported alongside experimental values. The mathematical formulation of G-1theory also allows for the determination of vibrational ZPE corrections. The researchers concluded that the G-1 method accurately predicts the reaction energies with the target range. Furthermore, they note the extent of the chosen basis is to balanced between the dissociating atoms to give proper energetic values. There are two limitations of G-1 theory discussed. One limitation is the G-1 correction is dependent on paired electrons, and thus can't be reliably used to map continuous potential surfaces that connect with unbound regions where the unpaired species lie. Triple exicitations demonstrate poor performance with this theory and gives inadaquate descriptions of correlations of electrons in different orbitals.},
