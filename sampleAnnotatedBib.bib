  annote = {This is a merger of theoretical thermochemistry with fragment based methods in order to generalize the use of an isodesmic bond separation approach to energy calculations on large organic molecules. It employs the idea of using systematic error canceling reaction schemes in a generalized connectivity based hierarchy to permit use lower level theory and subsequent extrapolation to CCSD(T) to calculate energies at sub-kcal/mol accuran acy. This approach is not limited to hydrocarbons, but works for organic molecules with unlimited numer of heteroatoms.},
